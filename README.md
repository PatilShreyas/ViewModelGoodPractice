# ViewModel Good Practices🦸‍♂️

This is a example repository to demonstrate the good practices of using `ViewModel` and how usage of `AndroidViewModel` can make things worst in a codebase.

This repository have both the implementation (good and bad).

## 👨‍💻 Implementation

- [Branch `bad-implementation`](https://github.com/PatilShreyas/ViewModelGoodPractice/tree/bad-implementation): Implementation using `AndroidViewModel`.
- [Branch `refactor`](https://github.com/PatilShreyas/ViewModelGoodPractice/tree/refactor): Implementation using `ViewModel` and segregated logic.

If you are just interested in the ➕***diff***➖ of both the approaches then [**refer to this Pull Request**](https://github.com/PatilShreyas/ViewModelGoodPractice/pull/1)
